# Modern Science Ontology (ModSci)
Modern Science Ontology (ModSci) is an upper ontology for modeling relationships between modern science branches and related entities, such as scientific discoveries, phenomena, renowned scientists, instruments, etc. 
ModSci provides a unifying framework for the various domain ontologies that make up the Science Knowledge Graph Ontology Suite. 
ModSci is a poly-hierarchical ontology that can be utilized in semantic web applications. 

## Ontology Publishing
The ontology is published under a persistent URL (https://w3id.org/skgo/modsci#) with dereferenceable URIs. 
We configured the server to provide human-readable HTML content from the vocabulary URI using the recipes provided in [Best Practice Recipes for Publishing RDF Vocabularies](https://www.w3.org/TR/swbp-vocab-pub/).



## Use cases
ModSci powers two projects for semantically representing scholarly information: 
- [Open Research Knowledge Graph](https://www.orkg.org/orkg/): for the categorization of research papers 
- [OpenResearch.org](https://www.openresearch.org/wiki/Main_Page):for the categorization of the information about scientific events, research projects, scientific papers, publishers, and journals.
